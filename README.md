This project contains pre-built Docker Images for Buildkite to perform build tasks as fast as possible. Currently, it is derivered from Amazon's CodeBuild Repository thsat is adapted for Buildkite environment.



## How to use with `docker-compose`



Assume you have `docker-compose.yml` in `.buildkite/`

```

      - docker#v3.5.0:
          image: "bkenvio/ubuntu:latest"
